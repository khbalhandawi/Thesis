\SetAbstractEnText{This thesis presents novel design methodologies for obtaining a set of design solutions that can address design requirements that may change during the design process or over a product or system’s lifetime. These methodologies aim at supporting design engineers quantitatively so they can make informed decisions in the early phases of product development when uncertainty is high.
The presented methodologies consider design problems commonly encountered in industry. The applications used in this thesis demonstrate the efficacy of these methodologies and are centered around product remanufacturing by means of direct energy deposition, an additive manufacturing technique. Specifically, they aim at providing design solutions in the form of geometry of the deposit and the remanufacturing process parameters. 
The first methodology considers remanufacturing as a strategy to address changing requirements in design problems. Sets of optimal design solutions, as opposed to single-point designs, are obtained using numerical optimization. The optimization problem objective is to maximize structural performance subject to design and process constraints. Since optimality and feasibility depend on varying design parameters, parametric studies are conducted to obtain optimal solutions for different parameter values. A response surface of the optimization solutions captures the effect of changing one or more parameters on the optimal solution and provides a method to map designs from the design space to the parameter space. In the parameter space, a manufacturing transition rule is formulated to identify sets of design solutions that are scalable by additive manufacturing. The transition rule is based on the physical limitations of the manufacturing method. Scalable design solutions are then mapped back to the design space to obtain the corresponding design variable values. This methodology draws inspiration from set-based design principles used to generate sets of design solutions rather than converging to a single design solution early in the product development process. 
The first methodology focuses on making decisions using information that is available to the designer. Since product development involves several design iterations and stages, a second methodology for making decisions based on information from past iterations is introduced in this thesis. It focuses on additive manufacturing problems where design requirements remain constant throughout a time interval referred to as an epoch and only change at discrete times in between epochs. This results in a series of design decisions that must be made at the end of each epoch referred to as a decision arc. This methodology considers selecting the best combination of design decisions from a set of discrete design choices. A combinatorial optimization problem is formulated to minimize the level of overdesign subject to reliability constraints. The reliability constraints are computed by evaluating the probability that a design will satisfy a design requirement given by a joint probability density function. Several design requirements are chained together and defined at the end of each epoch to form a requirement arc. Several requirement arc samples are generated using importance sampling. The combinatorial optimization problem is solved for each requirement arc to obtain a set of corresponding decision arcs. This set of optimal decision arcs is compared against sets of robust and flexible designs arcs. A tradespace is used to visualize the design sets and identify the relative degree of flexibility and robustness in the set of optimal decision arcs.
The remanufacturing of a turbine rear structure, an aeroengine structural component is used to test the proposed methodologies. A stiffener is deposited on the outer casing of the turbine rear structure to increase its stiffness when subjected to thermal loads due to the exhaust gases. The first methodology is used to determine the set of optimal stiffener designs and the set of scalable stiffener designs by optimizing the geometry and laser power used to deposit the stiffener. The second methodology is used to identify the set of optimal design arcs by chaining together several discrete stiffener designs to minimize the overall level of overdesign while maintaining a threshold reliability throughout the design process or the product’s lifecycle.
The two methodologies form a complete set-based design paradigm for addressing changing requirements in design problems featuring continuous and discrete design variables for instantaneous or progressive change in the design requirements.}
